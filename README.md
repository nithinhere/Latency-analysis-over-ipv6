# Latency-analysis-over-ipv6
UDP, TCP, http, https over ipv6
Both client and server programs are set up. Latency is analyzed between client and server carefully by 
observing the request/ response time.

Http and https requests information from server. The server renders chunk of data to the client. 

Steps to follow. udp and tcp- Python
1. open two terminals one for client and another for server.
2. create client and server programs in two terminals.
3. start the sever first by running server program
4. Server listens for client
5. run client program now
6. Latency time will be printed in the console.

Http and https - Node.js
1. just run the client.js program. 
2. server automatically recognizes the client as security checking is disabled in https.
3. console..log(string); to print the recieved the data. 
4. Overall latency time is calculated.
